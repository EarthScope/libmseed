* Add some mseed3 parsing tests, reference data.

* Remove last from ms3_readmsr(), last and fpos from two other family routines
  - The last indicator is a crutch and increasingly wrong with unknown stream lengths
  - the fpos from the _r and _selection members is undeeded as the MSFP can be inspected.

Add initializer for 
static MS3Tolerance tolerance = { .time = NULL, .samprate = NULL };
and for
MS3TraceID
maybe for
MS3TraceSeg

Thread safe logging possible?  Global parameters, i.e.:
__thread MSLogParam gMSLogParam = MSLogParam_INITIALIZER;

Add 'const' to:
extern int ms_sid2nslc (char *sid, char *net, char *sta, char *loc, char *chan);
extern int ms_nslc2sid (char *sid, int sidlen, uint16_t flags,
                        char *net, char *sta, char *loc, char *chan);
