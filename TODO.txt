* Handle unhandle-able years like 0000 in timing exception blockettes. XB_ELYSE HH? channels example

* New test rig?  Unit tests would be good...

* Add some mseed3 parsing tests, reference data.

* change json handling to yyjson.  Test performance difference.  Need data for testing that requires EHs, ~/data/2Year.TA.MSTX.mseed has events headers
Issues: JSON Pointer get syntax, change dot-notation or adapt.  Not set function for Pointer, would need to write.

* Remove last from ms3_readmsr(), last and fpos from two other family routines
  - The last indicator is a crutch and increasingly wrong with unknown stream lengths
  - the fpos from the _r and _selection members is undeeded as the MSFP can be inspected.

Add initializer for 
static MS3Tolerance tolerance = { .time = NULL, .samprate = NULL };
and for
MS3TraceID
maybe for
MS3TraceSeg
