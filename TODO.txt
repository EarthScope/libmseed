* Selection file mapping, matching.  How to handle wildcard locations?  Needs testing.

* miniSEED 2.4 packing?

* MSBuild project for building, MS Visual Studio 2017 dropped support for NMake
  - Use CMake to build project files?

* Handle splitversion in mstl3_addmsr().

* Functionality for Recenter headers

* Optional functionality with a bit flag:
#define MSF_SEQUENCE    0x0008  /* Maintain a record-level sequence number */

* Add msr3_parsebuffer() to parse all records from a buffer.

* Use SID 'sid' instead of TSID 'tsid', refer to source identifier?

Extra handling:
- Fetch/extraction for event detection, calibration and timing structures
- Delete methods?

Loss from miniSEED 2.x:
- Beam 400 & 405
- Blockette 2000
- Multiple "Clock Model" designations if multiple Blockette 500s
- "sequence" numbers are now optional
- data quality indicator is now optional

Things that need consideration:

- Identifiers: convention for location codes, expanded channel codes
