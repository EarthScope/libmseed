* Selection file mapping, matching.  How to handle wildcard locations?

* miniSEED 2.4 packing?

* MSBuild project for building, MS Visual Studio 2017 dropped support for NMake

* Handle splitversion in mstl3_addmsr().

* Optional, validation of CRC on read

Extra handling:
- Fetch/extraction for event detection, calibration and timing structures
- Delete methods?

Loss from miniSEED 2.x:
- Beam 400 & 405
- Blockette 2000
- Multiple "Clock Model" designations if multiple Blockette 500s
- "sequence" numbers
- data quality indicator

Things that need consideration:

- Identifiers: underscores?  special handling for locations?
- byte order
- extra header container
- extra header time format (YYYYDDDThh:mm:ss.ffffffffZ, always Z) ? or YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss for extremely broad support
- Mapping of quality to publication version
