* Add to porting guide:
 - MS3TraceList->numtraces -> numtraceids

* Update yyjson to new writers

* Remove last from ms3_readmsr(), last and fpos from two other family routines
  - The last indicator is a crutch and increasingly wrong with unknown stream lengths
  - the fpos from the _r and _selection members is undeeded as the MSFP can be inspected.

Add initializer for 
static MS3Tolerance tolerance = { .time = NULL, .samprate = NULL };
and for
MS3TraceID
maybe for
MS3TraceSeg
