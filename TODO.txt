* Selection file mapping, matching.  How to handle wildcard locations?  Needs testing.

* miniSEED 2.4 packing?

* MSBuild project for building, MS Visual Studio 2017 dropped support for NMake
  - Use CMake to build project files?

* Add some xSEED/mseed3 parsing tests, reference data.

Loss from miniSEED 2.x:
- Beam 400 & 405
- Blockette 2000
- Multiple "Clock Model" designations if multiple Blockette 500s
- "sequence" numbers are now optional
- data quality indicator is now optional
